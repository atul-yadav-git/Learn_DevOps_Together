## Introduction
-  Terraform modules break down infrastructure code into reusable components.
-  Understanding Terraform modules is crucial for efficiently managing infrastructure as code. 
-  Modularization helps address challenges such as lack of ownership, difficulty in maintenance, and testing complexities. 

## Parallel between Terraform Modules and Microservices:

1. **Modularization** üß©: 
   - In microservices, applications are broken down into smaller, independent services. Similarly, Terraform modules break down infrastructure configurations into smaller, reusable components.

2. **Scalability and Flexibility** üöÄ:
   - Microservices allow for scalability and flexibility by enabling teams to independently develop, deploy, and scale services. Similarly, Terraform modules facilitate scalability and flexibility by allowing teams to work on separate components of infrastructure configurations.

3. **Clear Ownership and Responsibility** üë•:
   - Microservices promote clear ownership and responsibility for each service, enhancing collaboration and accountability. Similarly, Terraform modules provide clear ownership and responsibility for infrastructure components, improving manageability and maintenance.

4. **Reduced Complexity and Maintenance** üõ†Ô∏è:
   - Microservices reduce the complexity and maintenance burden of monolithic applications by dividing functionality into smaller, manageable units. Similarly, Terraform modules alleviate the complexity and maintenance challenges of monolithic Terraform configurations by organizing infrastructure code into modular, reusable units.

## Advantages of using module 
1. **Modularity** üß©:
   - Terraform modules allow breaking down infrastructure configuration into smaller, self-contained components, making it easier to manage and reason about infrastructure.

2. **Reusability** üîÅ:
   - With modules, reusable templates for common infrastructure components can be created, reducing duplication and promoting consistency.

3. **Simplified Collaboration** ü§ù:
   - Modules facilitate collaboration on infrastructure projects, streamlining development and reducing conflicts in the codebase.

4. **Versioning and Maintenance** üîÑ:
   - Modules can have their own versioning, making updates and changes more manageable and preventing unexpected changes in existing deployments.

5. **Abstraction** üåê:
   - Modules abstract away the complexity of underlying resources, allowing users to focus on high-level parameters.

6. **Testing and Validation** ‚úîÔ∏è:
   - Modules can be individually tested and validated, reducing the risk of errors propagating across infrastructure.

7. **Documentation** üìù:
   - Modules promote self-documentation, making it easier for others to understand and work with them.

8. **Scalability** üìà:
   - Modules provide a scalable approach to managing complexity as infrastructure grows.

9. **Security and Compliance** üîí:
   - Modules can encapsulate security and compliance best practices, ensuring consistency and compliance across deployments.

module "local_example" {
  source = "./path/to/local/module"
}
```

```hcl
module "registry_example" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "2.0.0"
}
```

```hcl
module "github_example" {
  source = "github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc"
}
```
