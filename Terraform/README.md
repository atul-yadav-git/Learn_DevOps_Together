# Terraform Learning Repository

Welcome to the Terraform Learning Repository! üöÄ This repository is a space for sharing and learning about Terraform, a powerful infrastructure as code (IaC) tool.


## Main thing to know about Terraform:

-  Before delving into Terraform, it's essential to understand how to provision resources manually through the console of cloud providers.
-  Familiarize yourself with the required and optional fields involved in this process.
-  Once you grasp manual provisioning, you'll be better equipped to automate the same tasks using Terraform.
