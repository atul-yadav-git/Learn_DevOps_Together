# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Introduction
-  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a methodology that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure resources through machine-readable configuration files or scripts.
-  IaC is a method of managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through code.

## Need for IaC
-  Imagine a DevOps engineer tasked with deploying hundreds of applications. 
-  Manual deployment is a repetitive and time-consuming process. 
-  It's also error-prone, as even small mistakes can lead to inconsistencies and deployment failures.
-  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) offers a solution to these challenges.
-  By writing code to create and manage infrastructure resources, IaC automates the deployment process, streamlining deployments and improving their reliability. 
-  This allows DevOps engineers to focus on higher-level tasks like application development and troubleshooting.

### Benefits of IaC
- IaC eliminates repetitive, manual work by allowing the creation of scripts or configurations.
- Consistency is achieved as all resources are defined in code, reducing the risk of inconsistent environments.
- IaC provides scalability, control, and consistency to infrastructure management.

### API as Code in IaC
-  API as Code involves programmatically interacting with applications and services.
-  IaC leverages "API as code," where communication with the APIs of different cloud providers is utilized to create and manage resources.

## Provider-Specific IaC Tools
Different cloud providers have their native tools for IaC, such as  
```yaml
-  GCP: Google Cloud Deployment Manager (CDM) - YAML based
-  AWS: AWS CloudFormation Template, AWS CDK - YAML, JSON based
-  Azure: Azure Resource Manager - JSON
-  Terraform: Hybrid cloud - HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) based
```
While each provider has its tools, Terraform emerges as a preferred choice for managing hybrid cloud environments.

## The Need for Hybrid Cloud and Terraform:
-  Say, DevOps engineer automates infrastructure provisioning using AWS CloudFormation templates.
-  However, when migrating to a different cloud provider like Azure, the engineer needs to rewrite the scripts due to incompatibility.
-  Similar challenges arise when transitioning to an on-premises infrastructure using OpenStack.
-  This highlights the limitations of cloud-specific IaC tools.
-  Terraform, a tool developed by HashiCorp, allows DevOps engineers to write infrastructure scripts using a declarative language, enabling automation across different cloud providers.

## Terraform - A Hybrid Cloud Solution
-  Terraform is a tool that communicates with cloud provider APIs to provision and manage resources.
-  It abstracts the underlying APIs of different providers, making it an ideal choice for hybrid cloud scenarios.

## Benefits of Terraform
-  Ability to use a single tool to manage resources on multiple cloud providers.
-  Easier migration between cloud providers with minimal script changes.
-  Elimination of the need to learn multiple cloud-specific tools.
