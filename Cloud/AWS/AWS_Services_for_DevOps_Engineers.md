# *Important AWS Services for DevOps Engineers*

## Introduction
```
AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides a wide range of services to simplify complex tasks for users.

While AWS offers around 200 services, it's essential for DevOps engineers to focus on key services relevant to their role.
```
### Key AWS Services
1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**
   - Deploy applications on EC2 instances.
   - Configure instances for various purposes, such as web hosting.

2. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**
   - Understand VPC components, security groups, subnet ranges.
   - Define inbound/outbound traffic rules for secure EC2 instances.

3. **EBS (Elastic Block Store):**
   - Gain understanding of EBS volumes.
   - Attach storage to EC2 instances, store data, and manage snapshots/backups.

4. **S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
   - Learn about S3 buckets.
   - Use it as a scalable and cost-effective storage service for files, data, and backups.

5. **IAM (Identity and Access Management):**
   - Manage user access and permissions within AWS.
   - Configure policies for different roles and control resource access.

6. **CloudWatch:**
   - AWS service for monitoring and observability.
   - Track and log actions/events, set up alarms, and receive notifications.

7. **Lambda:**
   - Serverless compute service for executing functions in response to events.
   - Integrate with CloudWatch for automation and notifications based on specific events.

   - Automate infrastructure provisioning.

2. **CodePipeline:**
   - Automate continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

3. **CodeDeploy:**
   - Automate application deployment.

4. **Auto Scaling:**
   - Dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
   - Save costs during low-traffic periods and ensure high availability during peak times.

5. **CloudTrail:**
   - Audit and monitor API activity in your AWS account.
