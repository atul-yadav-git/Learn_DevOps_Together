# Virtual Machines and Hypervisor in DevOps

## 1. Need for Virtualization:
   - Lets delves into virtual machines using a real-world example to enhance understanding.
   - Say there's a person owning a one-acre plot of land and building a house on it.
   - Initially, they use the entire land but later realize they only need half an acre to live comfortably.
   - To make better use of the land, they decide to build another property on the unused portion and rent it out. This way, they utilize the resources more efficiently.
   - Similarly, in the software industry, servers are used to deploy applications, and if server resources are underutilized, it leads to inefficiency.

## 2. Underutilization and Inefficiency:
   - Servers in the software industry are analogous to the land in the example.
   - Underutilization or inefficient resource distribution among teams can lead to inefficiency.

## 3. Role of Virtualization:
   - Virtualization addresses underutilization by installing a hypervisor.
   - A hypervisor is software that creates virtual machines on physical servers.

## 4. Virtual Machine Creation:
   - Instead of physically dividing the server, virtualization creates logical partitions or virtual machines within it.
   - Each virtual machine functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, and hardware resources.

## 5. Hypervisor Management:
   - The hypervisor manages virtual machines independently, eliminating dependencies among them.
   - This concept of virtual machines significantly improves efficiency and aligns with the optimization focus of DevOps.

## 6. Popular Hypervisors:
   - Popular hypervisors such as VMware and Xen as tools for creating virtual machines.

## 7. Cloud Platforms and Virtual Machines:
   - Cloud platforms like Amazon, Microsoft, or GitHub use the concept of virtual machines in their data centers.
   - Cloud providers have large data centers with thousands or millions of physical servers.

## 8. User Requests and Hypervisor Functionality:
   - Users can request virtual machines from specific regions on cloud platforms.
   - The user's request is fulfilled by the hypervisor on one of the physical servers, creating the requested virtual machine.
