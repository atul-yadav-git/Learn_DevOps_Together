- Github is separate and git is separate

Github = remote repo (online github that we see; its like storing your code on cloud; you are not dependent on your local system; anytime you can refer your code through github access and if its public others can also see and contribute open source project concept)


Git = local system repo ( locally on your system code is there; you can work on it and do version control and build stuff but when want to share it with others for collaboration or review; have to put it into github to allow that distributed version control and collaboration)
