- Github is separate and git is separate

Github = remote repo 
(online github that we see; its like storing your code on cloud; you are not dependent on your local system; anytime you can refer your code through github access and if its public others can also see and contribute open source project concept)


Git = local system repo 
( locally on your system code is there; you can work on it and do version control and build stuff but when want to share it with others for collaboration or review; have to put it into github to allow that distributed version control and collaboration)

So for git and github authentication, two ways, ssh or https using pat(personal access token; password is not recommended) -> 
Ssh -> first time setup of key genertaion and then key storage is little work, but then on , no need to enter password each time while interacting with remote repo, also more secure due to public private key cryptography

Https (using pat) -> https is like username and password where instead of password we can create pat on github and use that for authenticate  bet github repo and local repo ; but have to enter pat regularly, ssh is more recommended and only one time setup issue then on much simpler; https using pat can be used where firewall or proxies are blocking ssh connection

Im going to go with ssh method for authentication git as only first time setup issue then on much simpler to work with remote repo and my local git repos



the pattern I mentione In .gitignore file , it will serach for it in that directory and all sub directoryies within that directory; but it will not apply to whole system or something only from directory where the gitignore file is present; it will not track that file, good for files that we dont want others to access like secrets or confidential
