# Git Branching Strategy

## Introduction
```
The primary goal of any organization is to deliver releases to customers on time, ensuring prompt delivery of new features.

To achieve this goal, it is important to have an efficient branching strategy in place.
```

### What is a Branch in Git?
```
Branches in Git are used to separate code changes and facilitate parallel development without affecting the main codebase.
```

### Types of Branches
1. **Main Branch:**
   - The master/main branch is the default branch and is typically kept for active development.
   - Changes from feature branches and hotfix branches are merged into the master branch once they are considered stable.

2. **Feature Branch:**
   - Feature branches are created for developing new features or making significant changes to existing functionality.
   - Multiple developers can collaborate on these branches, and once the changes are deemed satisfactory, they are merged into the main branch.

3. **Release Branch:**
   - Release branches are created when the development on a particular version is completed, and the code is ready to be shipped to customers.
   - Release branches undergo thorough testing and are used to build and deliver the application to customers.

4. **Hotfix/Bugfix Branch:**
   - Hotfix branches are created to address critical issues in the production environment.
   - They allow for quick fixes, and the changes are merged into both the master branch and the current release branch to ensure the fixes are deployed.


## Importance of Branching Strategy
```
A proper branching strategy is needed to ensure timely delivery of new features to customers.

Branches allows developers to work on different features or changes without affecting the main codebase.

The purpose of creating branches is to prevent any new changes from affecting the existing functionality until they are thoroughly tested and ready to be merged back into the main branch.
