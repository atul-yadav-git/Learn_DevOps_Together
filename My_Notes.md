# To Do Automation For DevOps Remember 
```
1. every application has documentation about how to communicate with its api, just google it, like github api, aws api, jira, bit bucket, so on 
 
2. start with commands already available, understand , learn, use it and as u go on, u can modify it to ur own liking as u want and create stuff

3. go through 10 examples of topic or tool; understand it and then try to implement something through it

4. Actively practice and programmatically perform tasks through APIs for automation, a fundamental aspect of DevOps.
