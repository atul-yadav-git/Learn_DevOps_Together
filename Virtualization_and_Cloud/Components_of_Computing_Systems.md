# **Components of Computing Systems**

### 1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- The CPU serves as the brain of a computer or server.
- It performs calculations, executes instructions, and manages overall system operations.
- CPU speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz), determining processing speed.

### 2. Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory)
- RAM is temporary storage for actively processed data and instructions.
- Fast but volatile, it loses contents when power is off.
- More RAM enhances data access and overall performance.

### 3. Storage
- Refers to permanent storage (HDDs and SSDs).
- Non-volatile, retains data even when powered off.
- HDDs offer large capacities at lower costs; SSDs are faster but pricier.

### 4. Networking
- Involves data transfer between computers/devices over a network.
- Encompasses hardware (routers, switches, cables) and software (protocols, standards).
- Crucial for applications requiring data transfer and online connectivity.
