# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Introduction

IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS provides a robust framework for managing users, groups, and roles, allowing granular control over access to AWS resources.

## IAM Users

### Overview
- IAM Users are individual entities with unique credentials used to access AWS resources.
- Typically created for team members, such as developers, testers, and administrators.

### Use Case
- Create a separate IAM user for each team member.
- Assign permissions based on individual requirements for performing specific tasks.

## IAM Groups

### Overview
- IAM Groups are collections of IAM users.
- Useful for simplifying permission management for multiple users with similar access requirements.

### Use Case
- Instead of assigning permissions individually to each user, create a group for a set of users with common access needs.
- Grant necessary permissions to the group, and users inherit them automatically.

## IAM Roles

### Overview
- IAM Roles are used when one AWS service needs temporary access to another AWS service for specific tasks.
- Roles have policies attached, defining the permissions granted.

### Use Case
- Example: AWS Lambda needing access to S3, RDS, etc., for a specific operation.
- Create a role with the required permissions and attach it to the AWS service.

## Summary

IAM provides a flexible and secure way to manage access to AWS resources, whether for individuals, groups, or services. Understanding the distinctions between IAM Users, Groups, and Roles is crucial for effective access control and resource utilization in AWS.
