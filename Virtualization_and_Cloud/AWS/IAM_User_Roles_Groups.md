# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) & Identity Centre
```
Both AWS IAM and Identity Center are crucial tools for managing access and identities in your AWS environment. However, they serve different purposes.
```
 
# AWS IAM

IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS provides a robust framework for managing users, groups, and roles, allowing granular control over access to AWS resources.

### Purpose

Manages user access and permissions within AWS.

## IAM Users

### Overview
- IAM Users are individual entities with unique credentials used to access AWS resources.
- Typically created for team members, such as developers, testers, and administrators.

### Use Case
- Create a separate IAM user for each team member.
- Assign permissions based on individual requirements for performing specific tasks.

## IAM Groups

### Overview
- IAM Groups are collections of IAM users.
- Useful for simplifying permission management for multiple users with similar access requirements.

### Use Case
- Instead of assigning permissions individually to each user, create a group for a set of users with common access needs.
- Grant necessary permissions to the group, and users inherit them automatically.

## IAM Roles

### Overview
- IAM Roles are used when one AWS service needs temporary access to another AWS service for specific tasks.
- Roles have policies attached, defining the permissions granted.

### Use Case
- Example: AWS Lambda needing access to S3, RDS, etc., for a specific operation.
- Create a role with the required permissions and attach it to the AWS service.

## IAM Policies
- Documents defining permissions granted to users, groups, and roles.

### Most Used Practical Things

- Creating and managing users with appropriate access levels.
- Assigning users to groups to simplify permission management.
- Creating roles with specific permissions for AWS services.
- Using policies to grant granular control over resource access.
- Implementing the least privilege principle (granting only the minimum required permissions).

# AWS IAM Identity Center

### Purpose

Simplifies managing human user access to multiple AWS accounts and applications.

### Benefits

- Single sign-on (SSO): Enables users to access multiple accounts and applications with a single login.
- Centralized access management: Manage user access across all your AWS accounts from one place.
- Integration with various identity providers: Connect with existing identity directories (e.g., Active Directory) for user management.

### Most Used Practical Things

- Connecting existing identity providers for centralized user management.
- Assigning users access to specific AWS accounts and applications.
- Simplifying user access governance across multiple AWS environments.
- Leveraging SSO for a smoother user experience.

## Understanding the Difference

IAM focuses on managing individual identities (users, groups, roles) and their permissions within specific AWS accounts.

Identity Center focuses on managing user access across multiple accounts and applications, often leveraging existing identity providers for centralized governance.

## Summary

IAM provides a flexible and secure way to manage access to AWS resources, whether for individuals, groups, or services. 

Identity Center builds upon IAM, providing centralized management and simplified access across multiple accounts and applications.

Understanding the distinctions between IAM Users, Groups, and Roles is crucial for effective access control and resource utilization in AWS.
