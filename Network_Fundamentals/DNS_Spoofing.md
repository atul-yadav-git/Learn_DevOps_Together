# DNS Spoofing

## Introduction
DNS Spoofing is a malicious attack that involves altering the DNS (Domain Name System) records to redirect users to fraudulent websites or intercept their network traffic. By manipulating the DNS resolution process, attackers can deceive users into visiting malicious websites or provide false information.

## Explanation
DNS Spoofing takes advantage of the trust placed in DNS to resolve domain names to IP addresses. When a user requests the IP address of a specific domain, their device sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which responds with the corresponding IP address. However, in a DNS spoofing attack, the attacker intercepts this communication and provides a false IP address, redirecting the user to a different destination.

## Examples
- In a DNS spoofing attack, an attacker may alter the DNS records of a popular banking website. When users attempt to access the legitimate website, they are redirected to a fraudulent site that looks identical to the original. The attacker can then capture sensitive information, such as login credentials.
- Another example is redirecting users trying to access popular social media platforms to malicious websites that distribute malware or collect personal data without their knowledge.

## Syntax
DNS Spoofing attacks can be executed using various techniques, such as DNS cache poisoning, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing, or by compromising DNS servers.

## Key Bullet Points
- DNS Spoofing involves altering DNS records to redirect users to malicious or fraudulent websites.
- Attackers intercept DNS queries and provide false IP addresses.
- DNS cache poisoning, ARP spoofing, and compromised DNS servers are common techniques used in DNS spoofing attacks.
