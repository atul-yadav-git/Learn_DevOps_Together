# Load Balancing

## 1. Introduction
Load balancing is a technique used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization, improve reliability, and enhance performance. It ensures that no single server becomes overwhelmed with requests, thus improving the overall efficiency of the network.

## 2. Explanation
Load balancing works by distributing incoming network traffic across a group of servers, also known as a server cluster or server farm. It ensures that each server in the cluster shares an equal or balanced workload, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

## 3. Examples
- **Web servers:** Load balancing is commonly used to handle high traffic loads, evenly distributing requests among multiple servers.
- **Application servers:** Load balancing ensures efficient processing of client requests and optimal utilization of server resources.
- **Database servers:** Load balancing can be applied to distribute database queries, improving response times and increasing capacity.

## 4. Load Balancing Algorithms
- **Round Robin:** Distributes requests equally among servers in sequential order.
- **Least Connection:** Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **Weighted Round Robin:** Distributes requests proportionally based on server weights.

## 5. Load Balancing Techniques
- **Hardware Load Balancers:** Dedicated devices providing advanced load balancing features and high performance.
- **Software Load Balancers:** Load balancing functionality implemented in software, often running on commodity hardware or virtual machines.
- **DNS Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic by configuring multiple IP addresses for a single domain name.

## 6. Key Bullet Points
- Load balancing distributes network traffic across multiple servers.
- It improves resource utilization, reliability, and performance.
- Load balancing algorithms determine how traffic is distributed.
- Different load balancing techniques include hardware load balancers, software load balancers, and DNS load balancing.
