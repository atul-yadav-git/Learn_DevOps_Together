- to do automation for devops remember ; every application has documentation about how to communicate with its api, just google it, like github api, aws api, jira, bit bucket, so on 
 
- start with commands already available, understand , learn, use it and as u go on, u can modify it to ur own liking as u want and create stuff

- go through 10 examples of topic or tool; understand it and then try to implement something through it; learn -> apply -> learn -> apply
