# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## 1. What is SDLC:
   - SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
   - It is a process followed in the software industry to design, develop, test, and deploy software products.
   - SDLC involves different phases, including planning, designing, building, testing, and deployment.
   - The end goal is to deliver a high-quality software product.

## 2. Phases of SDLC:
   1. **Planning Phase:**
      - Involves gathering requirements and getting feedback from customers.

   2. **Design Phase:**
      - High-level and low-level designs are created to define how the software will function and what technologies will be used.

   3. **Building Phase:**
      - Refers to the development of the software based on the design specifications.

   4. **Testing Phase:**
      - Crucial for ensuring the quality of the software.
      - Involves various types of testing, such as functional testing, performance testing, and security testing.

   5. **Deployment Phase:**
      - After successful testing, the software is ready for deployment, making it available to users.

   6. **Circular Approach:**
      - SDLC follows a circular approach, where each new feature or enhancement goes through the same phases.

## 3. SDLC in Practice - Example.com:
   - Taking the example of an organization called example.com (an e-commerce website) to understand how SDLC works in practice.
   1. The organization decides to launch a new feature, such as a kids' catalog.
   2. Planning and requirement phase involves gathering information and documenting requirements.
   3. In the design phase, high-level and low-level designs are created.
   4. The building phase involves actual software development based on design specifications.
   5. Testing phase ensures software quality through various methods.
   6. Once the software passes testing, it is ready for deployment.
   7. The circular approach means that each new feature goes through the same SDLC phases.

## 4. DevOps Role in SDLC:
   - As a DevOps engineer, focus primarily on the building, testing, and deployment phases.
   - Automation plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of these phases.
   - You can also get involved in other phases based on your interest and expertise.
   - Goal is to improve the organization's efficiency and suggest appropriate tools and processes for specific context.
